    <ol>
      <h3>A few questions:</h3>
      <li>What is the advantage of a switch vs if/else if/else statement? I feel like
        if/else statements might be able to handle more complex conditionals, whereas
        switches act as a "shorthand" by eliminating redundant/multiple if statements.</li>
      <li>When constructing a 'for' loop, do all 3 statements need to be written/used? Are any
        of the 3 statements (initial execution, condition, execution after condition) optional?</li>
      <li>In a 'for' loop, can multiple variables/conditions be executed before the code block?
        AKA, can multiple variables be written in statement 1?</li>
      <li>Is there a processing/speed advantage to using a 'while' loop vs a 'for' loop?</li>
      <li>If an array is created like a variable ("let array = []"), can we create arrays containing other
        arrays?</li>
